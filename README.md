# Repoisotory for the Deep Learning course at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS)
## List of contributors:
- Krzysztof Wiesniakowski
- Chigozie Ifepe
- Pedro Villadangos Benavides

The goal of the project was to perform evaluate deep learning model on novel SEN12-FLOOD dataset presented by Rambour et al. (2020).

The following repository contains the following:
 - `project_report` which contains all the necessary files used for report writing using Latex
 - `deep_learning_flooding.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file for performing the experiment (pre-processing the data, defining the model, compiling the model ect)
 - several folders which include sample data coming from: The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIII-B2-2020, 2020 XXIV ISPRS Congress (2020 edition
