The goal of the project was to perform evaluate deep learning model on novel SEN12-FLOOD dataset presented by Rambour et al. (2020).

Contained within this GitHub repository are sample folders showcasing the data utilized for training, validation, and testing of our deep neural network for flood detection. The repository includes JSON files that contain metadata for both Multispectral and SAR satellite data. Additionally, the primary Python notebook used to achieve the results is also provided.

In the function 'select_balanced_subset' it is possible to select the percentage of folders from the available folders to analyze and run in the deep neural network

The repository also includes an environment.yaml file which specifies all necessary dependencies, libraries, and their respective versions for replication purposes.
